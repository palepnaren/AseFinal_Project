Our application requires new users to fill out a "Profile".  The profile contains their demographic and insurance information, past and current medical history, complaints regarding their teeth, desired Orthodontic treatment, and pictures of their facial profile and teeth. Once the required Profile information is entered the user can then use the "Provider Search" to locate an Orthodontist near them. The Provider Search radius feature (defaults to 5 miles) allows the user to set the maximum distance, from their current location, to search for an Orthodontist. If the user finds one, or more, Orthodontists they would like to contact. They simply tap the map marker, for the given Orthodontist, and an email will be sent to the Orthodontist's clinic containing all their Profile information. The Orthodontist will then review the information and send the user an initial assessment of their condition. Based on this assessment the user can either schedule an office visit or seek the opinion of another Orthodontist.
